[This](https://github.com/sirredbeard/anboxonsolus/blob/master/install-anbox.sh) is a proof of concept script to get [Anbox](https://github.com/anbox/anbox) running on [Solus](https://solus-project.com/).

Anbox is a project using containers to run Android apps on Linux.

Solus Project is a very fast Linux distribution that is increasing in popularity.

Right now the script is incomplete.

Do not try to run it.

It won't work.

Please feel free to take a look at it though and help.

Thank you to teams at Solus and Anbox upon which this work is based.
