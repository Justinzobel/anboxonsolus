[This](https://github.com/sirredbeard/anboxonsolus/blob/master/install-anbox.sh) is a proof of concept script to get [Anbox](https://github.com/anbox/anbox) running on [Solus](https://solus-project.com/).

Right now it is incomplete.

Do not try to run it.

Thank you to teams at Solus and Anbox upon which this work is based.
